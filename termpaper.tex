Google released Android on November 5, 2007 \cite{open-handset-alliance-ann} as
a platform for consumer-level mobile devices, particularly phones.  Programmers
can write applications for Android in Java.  These programs are run with Dalvik
--- a virtual machine that Google created.  In 2010, Oracle~America~Inc.\ filed
a lawsuit against Google \cite{oracle-lawsuit}, claiming that Dalvik infringed
on Oracle's intellectual property.  Is Google's use of the Dalvik virtual
machine in Android ethical?  Creating Dalvik was the only way to ethically meet
performance, memory, and licensing restrictions, which aligns with the spirit of
the ACM Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice
\cite{secode}.

(It should be noted that the author of this paper is employed by Google at time
of writing.)

\section{Facts} % {{{1
\label{sec:facts}

In late 2007, Google (along with a handful of other companies) announced the
Open Handset Alliance \cite{open-handset-alliance-ann} along with the operating
system they wished to promote: Android.  The Android operating system uses a
modified Linux kernel --- an open source operating system --- along with a slew
of other open source projects, in order to provide an open source operating
system for phones.  Google provides a software development kit (SDK) that allows
developers to write applications for Android in the Java programming language.

Java is a programming language created by James Gosling that was originally
maintained by Sun Microsystems.  In 2006, Sun announced Java's release under the
open source GNU GPL license. \cite{sun-open-sources-java} On August 20, 2009,
the U.S.~Justice Department approved Oracle's deal to acquire Sun Microsystems,
along with its intellectual property, including Java. \cite{oracle-buys-sun}

Java does not get converted directly to CPU instructions --- in order to run
Java code, one must use a virtual machine. The Java compiler produces a
documented, well-defined set of standard bytecodes, known as the JavaVM
specification. \cite[Chapter 4]{javavm-bytecode}  There are many different
implementations of the JavaVM specification: HotSpot (Sun/Oracle's de facto
implementation) \cite{hotspot}, Apache Harmony \cite{apache-harmony}, and Red
Hat's IcedTea \cite{icedtea}, to name a few.  The developers of Android created
a new virtual machine --- Dalvik.

Dalvik executes bytecodes in a custom executable format \cite{dalvik-bytecode}
that is different from Oracle's HotSpot virtual machine \cite{javavm-bytecode}.
In order to fulfill the performance requirements and restrictions imposed by a
phone's hardware, Dalvik uses a different architecture to execute code.  The
Android SDK includes a program that converts a Java class file produced by
Oracle's Java compiler into the Dalvik executable format.
\cite{android-sdk-building}  In order to provide compatibility with the Java
libraries, Dalvik includes portions of the Apache Harmony library.
\cite{apache-harmony} \cite{dalvik-readme}  The Apache Harmony project is
released under the Apache License 2.0 \cite{apache-license} which is ``preferred
by many companies because such licenses make it possible to use open-source
software code without having to turn proprietary enhancements back over to the
open source software community.'' \cite{why-apache2-license}

On August 12, 2010, Oracle filed a lawsuit against Google, claiming that Dalvik
infringes upon their intellectual property. \cite{oracle-lawsuit}

\section{Research Question} % {{{1
\label{sec:question}
Is Google's use of the Dalvik virtual machine in Android ethical?

% end question }}}1

\section{Extant Arguments} % {{{1
\label{sec:args}

\subsection{Oracle's Claim} % {{{2
\label{sub:args_oracle}

Oracle's claim is that ``as a direct and proximate result of Googleâ€™s direct
and indirect willful copyright infringement, Oracle America has suffered, and
will continue to suffer, monetary loss to its business, reputation, and
goodwill.'' \cite[p.~9 line 11]{oracle-lawsuit}

The first claim being made is that Google is infringing on Oracle's copyright
(which would be unethical).  The second claim is that by infringing, Google is
harming the public by causing losses to Oracle's employees and investors.
Either of these actions would be unethical, and the first would certainly be
illegal.

\subsection{Groklaw's Response} % {{{2
\label{sub:args_groklaw}

When the lawsuit was announced, the website Groklaw posted an analysis of the
lawsuit.  Groklaw is a website run by Pamela Jones, an open source advocate who
previously worked as a paralegal. \cite{groklaw-pj} Jones responded to Oracle's
lawsuit, saying: \cite{groklaw}

\begin{quotation}
I expect Google would say Dalvik was an alternative to Java, not a version of
it. If indeed none of the Sun employees that ended up at Google worked on this,
and it's built from the ground up without any Sun technology or IP, on what
basis can Oracle prevail? Perhaps Oracle figures no room at Google is clean
enough. And of course clean room means nothing when it comes to patents.
\end{quotation}

Jones's argument is that if Google has not used any of Oracle's software to
build Dalvik, then there's no violation of intellectual property, and thus no
unethical behavior.

\section{Analysis} % {{{1
\label{sec:analysis}

%\begin{itemize}
%    \item \cite[\S 2.02]{secode} Not knowingly use software that is obtained or
%    retained either illegaly or unethically.
%
%    \item \cite[\S 2.06]{secode} Identify, document, collect evidence and
%    report to the client or the employer promptly if, in their opinion, a
%    project is likely to fail, to prove too expensive, to violate intellectual
%    property law, or otherwise to be problematic.
%
%    \item \cite[\S 3.01]{secode} Strive for high quality, acceptable cost and a
%    reasonable schedule, ensuring significant tradeoffs are clear to and
%    accepted by the employer and the client, and are available for
%    consideration by the user and the public.
%
%    \item \cite[\S 6.04]{secode} Support, as members of a profession, other
%    software engineers striving to follow this Code.
%
%    \item \cite[\S 7.03]{secode} Credit fully the work of others and refrain
%    from taking undue credit.
%\end{itemize}

\subsection{Criteria for Analysis} % {{{2
\label{sub:criteria}

In order to establish whether Google's actions are ethical or unethical, it is
important to provide an objective set of standards that are well-accepted for
the basis of this analysis.  At first glance, using Google's Code of Conduct
\cite{google-conduct} seems like a reasonable choice, and many parts of Google's
Code of Conduct are applicable here.  However, this analysis will use the ACM
Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice \cite{secode} as
it is non-partial and includes more restrictions than Google's Code of Conduct
does.

By this measure, Google would be unethical in creating Dalvik if it violated the
Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice \cite{secode} or
if there was a higher principle that it conflicts with.

% subsection criteria }}}2

\subsection{Requirements} % {{{2
\label{sub:requirements}

As part of a software engineer's duty to the product, a software engineer should
``approve software only if they have a well-founded belief that it is safe,
meets specifications, passes appropriate tests, and does not diminish quality of
life, diminish privacy or harm the environment.'' \cite[\S~1.03]{secode}  As
such, Dalvik must meet the requirements

\subsubsection{Licensing} % {{{3
\label{sub:licensing}

Google's implementation of Dalvik does not use any of Oracle's~HotSpot~VM, but
it uses portions of the Apache~Harmony libraries.  Apache~Harmony is released
under Apache~License~2.0 --- a software license that grants rights to
redistribute software, as long as distributors preserve the copyright notices
and note any modifications made.  \cite{apache-license} Google is then obligated
to distribute Dalvik under a license that has terms compatible with the
Apache~License~2.0.  Google distributes Dalvik under the same Apache~License~2.0
and credits Harmony in the Dalvik README.  \cite{dalvik-readme}  This follows
the Software Engineering Code principle of ``[crediting] fully the work of
others and [refraining] from taking undue credit.'' \cite[\S 7.03]{secode}

Section 2.02 of the Software Engineering Code states that software engineers
should ``not knowingly use software that is obtained or retained either
illegally or unethically.'' \cite[\S 2.02]{secode}  Instead of using Oracle's
libraries, Google used the Apache Harmony libraries.  Dalvik uses its own
executable format that is distinct from JavaVM.  Google created Dalvik and then
used Apache~Harmony to supplement its functionality, obeying all the terms of
the Apache~License~2.0.  All software was obtained legally, so that principle
has been upheld.

One of the requirements of Android was to provide a common platform for a wide
variety of phones \cite{open-handset-alliance-ann}; the only way to ensure a
common platform is to encourage widespread adoption.  Companies prefer the
Apache License 2.0 because of its less restrictive nature than the GPL.
\cite{why-apache2-license} By using the Apache License 2.0, Google can release
Android under an open source license without illegally using Oracle's software.

% subsubsection licensing }}}3

\subsubsection{Quality} % {{{3
\label{ssub:quality}

Furthermore, Google's creation of Dalvik upholds Section 3.01 of the Software
Engineering Code \cite{secode}, specifically, ``striv[ing] for high quality,
acceptable cost, and a reasonable schedule'' in a product.  Dalvik would not
have been completed in a reasonable amount of time without using portions of
Apache Harmony nor would it be as high quality if it had used Oracle's HotSpot.
HotSpot doesn't fit within the performance characteristics of lower-end phones.
There are other Java virtual machines that could have been used, but none met
the goals of the Android project.

% subsubsection quality }}}3

% subsection requirements }}}2

\subsection{The Use of Java} % {{{2
\label{sub:java}

\subsubsection{The dex Program} % {{{3
\label{ssub:dex}

dex, a part of the Android SDK, is a separate program that runs on Java
bytecodes and converts them to Dalvik bytecodes.  Converters could be
written that convert other programming languages to the Dalvik executable
format; there is no dependency on Java.  Dalvik just happens to include
libraries that are similar to those in the Java standard library.

% subsubsection dex }}}3

\subsubsection{Damages to Oracle} % {{{3
\label{ssub:oracle-damage}

(TODO: I will address the claim that damage has been done to Oracle.  Oracle has
not been damaged, and that by promoting the use of Java, Google's is actually
encouraging use of Oracle's products.)

% subsubsection oracle-damage }}}3

% subsection java }}}2

% section analysis }}}1

\section{Conclusion} % {{{1
\label{sec:conclusion}

The performance, power, and licensing requirements that Google had for Android
would not have been met by an existing virtual machine, so creating Dalvik was
the only ethical choice that Google could be made.
